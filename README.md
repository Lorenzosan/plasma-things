# plasma-things
This repo contains Matlab source files developed to analyze experimental data taken in the Plasma physics laboratory I,
at the Milan State University (academic year 2019/2020).

vacuum.m -> The script permits the calculation of the vacuum potential in the trap generated by the electrodes.
            It is possible to set the potentials for each electrode in a window as the program starts.
