# plasma-things
This repo contains Matlab source files developed to analyze experimental data taken in the Plasma physics laboratory I,
at the Milan State University (academic year 2019/2020).

vacuum.m -> The script permits the calculation of the vacuum potential in the trap generated by the electrodes.
            It is possible to set the potentials for each electrode in a separate window as the program starts.
            
cart_to_pol.m -> Converts matrix values from cartesian to polar grid

thomas_algorithm.m -> Given the system AX=B, where A is a tridiagonal matrix, this script takes as input the matrix A and
                      the vector B and returns the solution X.
                      
poisson.m -> This script solves the Poisson equation in the trap. You need to put in the same folder cart_to_pol.m, 
             thomas_algorithm.m and the electrical density matrix. The density filename shall be indicated in the 
             section 3 of source code.
             The ouput consists in three plots:
               * Plasma density
               * Electric potential inside the trap
               * Equipotential lines
